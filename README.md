I am a 25 year-old student, originally from the city of Luleå, studying at the [School of Entrepreneurship](https://www.cie.uu.se/industriell-teknik/utbildning/entreprenorskolan/) at [Uppsala University](https://uu.se) in Sweden, with a background in the Master's Programme in Computer and Information Engineering in which I enrolled in 2017. In addition to my studies, I've also taken a one year break from my studies during the entirety of 2021 working as Head of Corporate Relations at the [Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students](https://utn.se).

I like playing around with web apps as hobby projects alongside my studies, currently working mainly with Django. I'm also into photography, and have recently took part in the arrangement of the beloved Uppsala [River Rafting](https://forsranningen.utn.se).

At the moment I am writing my master's thesis in sustainable ICT procurement at Scania in Södertälje.
